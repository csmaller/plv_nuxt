FAQs

Schedule – Currently we are open from April through November and that is subject to change in the future.

HVAC – Due to the fact that we’re currently open seasonally, we do not have heat or AC in our tasting room. Please dress accordingly for the weather the day of your visit.  During the summer we have a steady sea breeze through the property which keeps those summer days comfortable.

Children– Children are welcome but must be supervised at all times. The vineyard is a working farm and not safe for children to wander unattended. 

Food –You can purchase snacks in our tasting room and we have a rotating schedule of food trucks on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Check out our events schedule to see the food truck line up.

Dogs – Dogs are welcome on our patio and greenspace only. Dogs must be leashed at all times and kept with their owners. Picking up after your dog is mandatory and if you don’t have bags, just ask us!

Disclaimer: We are huge dog lovers and want to be able to host our 4 legged friends as much as our human friends. We will continue to allow dogs unless there is an incident which forces us to change that rule. So don’t be the person who ruins it for everyone else. If your dog is aggressive please leave them home. 

Service Policy – Per state guidelines we have a strict serving policy at the vineyard. If any guest appears to be intoxicated we reserve the right not to serve them. This decision is made by the server on a case by case basis and is not to be negotiated. If a guest is disrespectful of this policy, they will be asked to leave. 

Large Groups – If you have a group of 8 or more planning to visit, just give us a call so we can prepare to accommodate you more comfortably.

Entertainment – We always have something going on at the vineyard. Check out our line up of live music and public events here!

Tours – Absolutely! If you want a private tour, just contact us  and we can schedule one! 

Photography – While you’re visiting, feel free to walk in the vines and take photos. We also welcome professional photo shoots by appointment only. Contact us to schedule a time!

Limos, Busses & Shuttles – We have space for larger vehicle parking but we ask that you schedule your large group visit with us so we can prepare to accommodate you more comfortably. 

Seating – We have ample seating in our tasting room, patio and greenspaces. But if you’re coming for a large public event or festival, feel free to bring your own chairs in case we run out!

ADA – If you require assistance of a wheelchair we provide handicapped parking next to our patio for easier access to our tasting room.
