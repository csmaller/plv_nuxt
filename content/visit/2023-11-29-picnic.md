While our tasting room and patio are beautiful spaces to enjoy your day at the vineyard, sometimes you want something a little more private and intimate to share with your favorite people. For those occasions where youâ€™re feeling a little more bougie, the private picnic in the vines package is the perfect setting! This package starts at $30 per person, is highly customizable for your group and includes a wine tasting and a dedicated server for you group of up to 6 people.
