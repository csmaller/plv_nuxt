While our tasting room and patio are beautiful spaces to enjoy your day at the vineyard, sometimes you want something a little more private and intimate to share with your favorite people. For those occasions where youâ€™re feeling a little more bougie, the private picnic in the vines package is the perfect setting! This package starts at $75 per person and includes a wine tasting and a dedicated server for you group of up to 6 people. Food is not included in this price, but you can fill a picnic basket with charcuterie treats in our specialty food store or, order ahead from our local charcuterie caterer [Savor the Spread](https://www.savorthespread.com/) in Marion and have it delivered to the vineyard for your picnic!
