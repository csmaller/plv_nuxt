Our tasting room is also home to our farm store. If you're craving a snack while visiting us, we've got you covered with a generous selection of international gourmet specialty foods as well as locally sourced cheeses, meats and handmade sweet treats to compliment your wine selections. Just grab one of our picnic baskets and create your own buffet of treats to enjoy on our patio or your own little picnic on the grass. Before you head home after your relaxing day at the vineyard, be sure to stroll through our store area to shop our inventory of branded merchandise, plants, candles, soaps, wine themed gifts, locally crafted art, a treat for your pup and much more. And of course, don't forget to grab a bottle of wine to go!
