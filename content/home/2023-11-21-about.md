NASKETUCKET BAY VINEYARD is Fairhaven’s first vineyard and winery. Our rustic barn setting, relaxed farm vibe and delicious wines and specialty food options makes this vineyard stand out from the rest. Wine tastings, wine flights, wine by the glass and spritzers are available for purchase to enjoy as you relax in our comfortable, stunning barn and patio area. Food trucks and live acoustic music can be expected weekly as well as regularly scheduled public events throughout the year. Check out our [events calendar](/events#calendar) for the full line up of live music, food trucks, craft sessions, holiday events and much more! Small private events can also be arranged to celebrate your special occasion. As we grow and evolve, more features and events will be added for our customers to enjoy. So stay in touch and continue to visit to see what’s new. Nasketucket Bay Vineyard is truly a unique place to spend the afternoon enjoying great wine, nature and loved ones in a magical setting.

Peace, Love, Vino my friends.
