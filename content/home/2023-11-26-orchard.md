While the grapes tend to take center stage here, they are not to be out done by our fruit orchard.  In 2023 we had our first sizeable pear harvest from our young little orchard. In addition to the grape vines we have cherry, pear, apple, plum and peach trees growing at the vineyard and we plan to incorporate the fruit into our wines, ciders and anything else we can come up with as the orchard matures and harvests become more plentiful.
