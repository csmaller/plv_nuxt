Starting a vineyard from scratch is not an easy undertaking but that’s exactly what we set out to do in 2016 after purchasing a retired dairy farm on New Boston road. The property was completely overgrown and the barn had definitely seen better days but underneath all that, there was a diamond in the rough that Nicholas Christy could see the vision for. After clearing 3 of the 52 acres the first plot, “Plot A” was planted next to the barn along with the orchard in 2017. Each year from there, we planted a new plot while chipping away at restoring the barn back to life. It was slow, hard work and there was a lot to learn but after a few years it started to actually look like a vineyard and the barn had been transformed. In 2020 we harvested Plot A for the first time and filled a whopping 5 gallon jug with what would become our signature Field Blend; “Rosie”. It has been a long road to get here with a lot of hurdles we didn’t see coming. These days the vines are more mature, the orchard is producing beautiful fruit and that rundown old barn is home to our beautiful tasting room and we can’t wait to share this magical place with our community.
