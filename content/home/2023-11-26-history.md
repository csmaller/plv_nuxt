Starting a vineyard from scratch is not an easy undertaking but that’s exactly what we set out to do in 2016 after purchasing a 52 acre retired dairy farm on New Boston road. The property was completely overgrown and the barn had definitely seen better days but underneath all that, there was a diamond in the rough that Nicholas Christy could see the vision for. After clearing a portion of the land, a test plot of four cold-hearty hybrid varietal grapes were planted in what is now “Plot A” next to the barn along with the orchard in 2017. Each year from there additional plots were planted while chipping away at restoring the barn back to life. It was slow, hard work and there was a lot to learn but after a few years it started to actually look like a vineyard and the barn had been transformed. In 2019 we harvested Plot A for the first time, which yielded 85 lbs. of grapes and filled a whopping five-gallon jug with what would later become our signature Field Blend. It has been a long road to get here with lots of hurdles we didn’t see coming but it was a labor of love. These days the vines are more mature, the orchard is also bearing fruit and that rundown old barn is home to our beautiful tasting room and we can’t wait to share the transformation of this magical place with our community.
